    "ANSWER : In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. It can be a single column or a combination of columns. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that each row in a table is uniquely identified. In other words, a primary key ensures that no two rows in a table can have the same values for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "For example, consider a \"students\" table with columns \"student_id\", \"name\", and \"age\". In this case, the \"student_id\" column could be used as the primary key because it uniquely identifies each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The purpose of a foreign key is to establish a relationship between two tables. This relationship is typically used to enforce referential integrity, which means that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "For example, consider a \"courses\" table with columns \"course_id\", \"name\", and \"instructor_id\". In this case, the \"instructor_id\" column could be a foreign key that refers to the primary key of an \"instructors\" table. This would establish a relationship between the \"courses\" and \"instructors\" tables, where each course is associated with a specific instructor.\n",
